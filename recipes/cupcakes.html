    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This easy vanilla cupcake recipe is made with simple ingredients. They are very tasty!</p>
    <h2>ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li> ¾ cup superfine sugar</li>        
        <li>3 large eggs </li>
        <li> 1½ cups self-rising flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract </li>
        </ul>
    <h2>steps</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 12-cup muffin tin or line cups with paper liners.</li>

    <li>Beat sugar and butter together in a large bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat in vanilla extract. Stir in flour just until mixed; spoon batter into the prepared muffin cups, filling each 3/4 full.</li>

    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the tops spring back when lightly pressed, 18 to 20 minutes. Cool in the tin briefly before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
